# Themis â€“ Sentiment Score Prediction Model (TRACE++ Architecture)

This repository contains **Sentiment Analysis 1.0**, the first version of the AI model used to predict employee sentiment inside the Themis HR system.

This version combines **structured behavioral data** and **textual feedback** to produce a sentiment class from 0 to 4. It is the core emotional intelligence layer that influences other downstream models like attrition risk, performance prediction, and role fitting.

>  **Note:** A future version (**Sentiment Analysis 2.0**) is planned, which will integrate real-time action images to enhance emotional recognition and improve prediction precision and usability in live enterprise environments.

##  Model Overview

The model is built on a dual-branch architecture known as **TRACE++**, an evolved version of the TRACE framework. It combines:

- A **Transformer + Autoencoder branch** for structured simulated behavior
- An **LSTM branch** for analyzing employee-written comments
- A **Fusion MLP** that joins both latent representations and outputs a softmax score

---

## Structured Branch (Transformer + Autoencoder)

Processes features like:
- Attendance behavior
- Hours present
- Interaction frequency
- Conflict counts
- Movement type and sitting posture
- Break and wandering time
- Collaboration and stress scores (derived)

### Why Transformer?
To learn complex interdependencies between behavioral signals without relying on manual weighting.

### Why Autoencoder?
To compress and denoise the attention-encoded feature space before classification, improving generalization.

---

##  Textual Branch (LSTM)

Processes written comments, complaints, feedback, or praises from employees.

### Why LSTM?
It understands the sequential and contextual structure of text, capturing tone, intent, and sentiment over time.

---

##  Fusion and Classification

The latent vectors from both branches are concatenated and passed through:

- Dense(64) â†’ ReLU  
- Dropout(0.3)  
- Dense(32) â†’ ReLU  
- Output: **Softmax over 5 sentiment classes** (0â€“4)

---

##  Output

The model outputs a single value:
- `0`: Extremely Negative  
- `4`: Extremely Positive

This score is used in:
-  Attrition Risk Prediction  
-  Performance Scoring  
-  Role Fit Recommendation (TBU)
